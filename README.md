Hi! I'm a Freshman in Cornell University's College of Engineering, and aim to major in CS and ECE. At Cornell, I'm a member of the Software-Autonomy subteam of the Cornell Electric Vehicles project team and the Maker Club. I'm primarily interested in Computer Science, Robotics, Cybersecurity, and decentralized cryptosystems.

In my free time, I like to read, learn card magic and coin tricks, develop automated scripts for me to use in my daily life, and customize my computer (running Endeavor-Hyprland).
