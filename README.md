Hi! I'm a Senior at Choate Rosemary Hall, a high school located in Wallingford, Connecticut. I'm interested in Computer Science, AI, Engineering, Cybersecurity, and Programming, mainly in Python.  
  
At school, I am the Lead Programmer and Lead Technician on the Choate FRC robotics team and am part of the Advanced Robotics Concentration special program. I'm a cello player in Choate's Concert Orchestra, and outside of classes, I am the President of the Choate Aerospace Association. I volunteer at Robotics and Beyond, where I teach students Python, Machine Learning, and Edge Computing.  
  
In my free time, I mess around with Rubik's cubes, learn card magic and coin tricks, develop automated scripts for me to use in my daily life, and customize my personal Arch Linux based distro.
