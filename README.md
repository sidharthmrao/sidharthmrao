### Hallo!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: Developing my first real software application (as in one that's not text based). No one is going to use it but me, but it's still fun.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Why people hate college apps. I am also currently working on automating major parts of my college application process lol
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Automation, My minecraft redstone computer, and Discworld.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My favorite programming language is BrainF*ck (jk it's Python)
